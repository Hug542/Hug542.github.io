## Probing the power of MaXOut in recurrent architectures

_Prof. Mausam, IIT Delhi_

  ▪ Probing the structural & representational properties of variants of LSTMs with various pooling types. 
  
  ▪ Analysing the link between robustness, biases and vanishing gradients in learning ability of models. 
  
  ▪ Analyses done on Text Classification and Natural Language Inference domains. 

## Adversarial Robustness against the Union of Multiple Perturbation Models

**Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA**

_Prof. Zico Kolter, Winter 2019_

The respository for this work can be found on the [Github](https://github.com/locuslab/robust_union) link.

A manuscript for the same is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04068)

## Image Dehazing for Low Computation Devices 

**Samsung Research and Development Headquarters, Suwon, South Korea**

_Summer 2019_

  ▪ Worked on the task of image dehazing for low computation scenarios like mobile devices and refrigerators. 

  ▪ Designed a novel loss function to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for low resource settings. 

  ▪ Model was 1500 times faster & 200 times lighter than the state-of-the-art with acceptable loss in quality. 

  ▪ Received Pre-Placement Offer for exceptional performance. Work done is in preparation for submission.

## PERSONA

**École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland**

_Prof. James Larus, Summer 2018_

  ▪ Worked on a TensorFlow based Cluster-scale, high-throughput bioinformatics framework, PERSONA. 

  ▪ Implemented Striped Smith-Waterman Algorithm to make gene sequencing computationally feasible. 

  ▪ Succeeded in speeding-up the sub-process of protein alignment by over 6 times. [[Presentation]](https://pratyush911.github.io/files/EPFL.pdf)
