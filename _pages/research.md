## [Why and when should you pool?  <br /> Analyzing Pooling in Recurrent Architectures](https://pratyushmaini.github.io/Pooling-Analysis/)

**_Prof. Mausam, IIT Delhi_**
- Analysing the link between robustness, biases and vanishing gradients in learning ability of models.   
- Propose a new pooling method max-attention, that outperforms other simple variants on various metrics examined.
- Analyses done on Text Classification domains. 

## Adversarial Robustness against the Union of Multiple Perturbation Models

**Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA**

**_Prof. Zico Kolter, Winter 2019_**

- Designed an algorithm for robustness against the union of multiple perturbations types (L1, L2, Linf).   
- Showed improved robustness exceeding previous benchmarks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

The respository for this work can be found on the [Github](https://github.com/locuslab/robust_union) link.

A manuscript for the same is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04068)

## Image Dehazing for Low Computation Devices 

**Samsung Research and Development Headquarters, Suwon, South Korea**

**_Summer 2019_**

- Worked on the task of image dehazing for low computation scenarios like mobile devices and refrigerators.    
- Designed a novel loss function to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for low resource settings.    
- Model was 1500 times faster & 200 times lighter than the state-of-the-art with acceptable loss in quality.    
- Received Pre-Placement Offer for exceptional performance. Work done is in preparation for submission.   

## PERSONA

**École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland**

**_Prof. James Larus, Summer 2018_**

- Worked on a TensorFlow based Cluster-scale, high-throughput bioinformatics framework, PERSONA.    
- Implemented Striped Smith-Waterman Algorithm to make gene sequencing computationally feasible.    
- Succeeded in speeding-up the sub-process of protein alignment by over 6 times. [[Presentation]](https://pratyushmaini.github.io/files/EPFL.pdf)
