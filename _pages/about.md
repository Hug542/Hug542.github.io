<p style="text-align: center;"><i> ~~ I like to Observe. Look for Patterns. Ponder over these Generalizations. Try to Refute them. Or otherwise prove their Validity. And re-image their Applications in alternate spheres ~~  </i></p>

Pratyush Maini
======
I am a Final Year Undergraduate Student of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi. My broad area of interest lies in the field of robust and explainable machine learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing architectures. I am advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/) for my B.Tech. thesis. 

I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to adapt and learn from the research styles of my amazing collaborators: [Prof. Zico Kolter](https://www.zicokolter.com), [Eric Wong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ericwong/) at CMU, [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io), [Xinyun Chen](https://junghyuk.github.io) at UIUC/UCB, [Prof. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr) at UofT/Vector and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus) at EPFL during research internships.
