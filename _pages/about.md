Pratyush Maini
======
I am a Final Year Undergraduate Student of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi. My broad area of interest lies in analyzing and developing robust, secure and explainable methods for machine learning and natural language processing. I am advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/) for my B.Tech. thesis. 

During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to adapt and learn from the research styles of my amazing collaborators: [Prof. Zico Kolter](https://www.zicokolter.com), [Eric Wong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ericwong/), [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/) at CMU, [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io), [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/), [Xinyun Chen](https://jungyhuk.github.io/) at UIUC/UCB, [Prof. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr) at UofT/Vector and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus) at EPFL during research internships.
