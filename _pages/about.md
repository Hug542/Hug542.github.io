I am a Final Year Undergraduate Student of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi. My broad area of interest lies in the field of robust and explainable machine learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing architectures. I am advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/) for my B.Tech. thesis. In the past, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Zico Kolter](www.zicokolter.com) at CMU and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus) at EPFL during research internships.
