<p style="text-align: center;"><i> ~~ I like to Observe. Look for Patterns. Ponder over these Generalizations. Try to Refute them. Or otherwise prove their Validity. And re-image their Applications in alternate spheres ~~  </i></p>

Pratyush Maini
======
I am a Final Year Undergraduate Student of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi. My broad area of interest lies in the field of robust and explainable machine learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing architectures. I am advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/) for my B.Tech. thesis. In the past, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Zico Kolter](www.zicokolter.com) at CMU and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus) at EPFL during research internships.
